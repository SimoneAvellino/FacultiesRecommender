Starting from the study of physics and medical statistics, the fundamentals of chemistry and biochemistry, the biological organization of living organisms, the phenomena of gene transmission and expression, the microscopic and macroscopic structure of the organism, the student will acquire knowledge of the mechanisms of the functioning of the human body in physiological conditions to then understand the causes of disease and the defense mechanisms that the organism implements also in relation to the microorganism-host relationship. The student will also acquire knowledge regarding ethical standards, bioethics, history and the transcultural approach to medicine. Knowledge of a foreign language (English) and of the main information systems will also be provided, as well as the basis for developing knowledge in the biotechnology and scientific research fields, through \"open-lab\" experiences. The first part of the internship (10% of the total) will also be carried out in the form of \"Nursing\" in the medical and surgical area to begin developing skills relating to patient management, team work and the organization of the healthcare facility.\n\nSECOND TWO-YEAR PERIOD\n\nDuring the second two years, knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms will be deepened and the approach to the patient and the disease will begin through the study of clinical methodology, the main laboratory methods, drugs and substances of abuse, anatomopathological pictures and their evolution with particular reference to prevention. Knowledge of the most relevant diseases of the various systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, digestive, urinary, skin), infectious diseases, diseases of the nervous system and psychiatry will be deepened. During the second two-year period, attendance at hospital facilities is expected to carry out a good part of the professional training (around 40% of the total) so that the knowledge acquired can be experienced in the field. The ability to clinically reason, to solve the most common problems in both the medical and surgical areas, to follow the evolution of the process from diagnosis to therapy, to understand when the intervention of a specialist is necessary will be among the skills developed through the activity practice. A specific internship in biomedical laboratories is also planned to refine skills and knowledge in the research field.\n\nTHIRD TWO-YEAR PERIOD\n\nDuring the third two-year period, the student will acquire all the useful elements to carry out his/her activity in order to maintain the overall state of health of the individual. The study of pharmacology and pathological anatomy will be completed and the knowledge relating to the diagnostic process will be perfected through knowledge of the main methodologies of diagnostic imaging. The student will acquire specific skills regarding the evaluation of epidemiological data, health promotion, prevention, and the area of clinical services medicine. They will learn to recognize various specialist pathologies (orthopaedics, physiatry, plastic and maxillofacial surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, rheumatology) taking into account their role, and will acquire knowledge regarding pediatric and gynecological pathologies also through the professional training activities provided. As part of the credits to be obtained as professional activities, the student will carry out 15 credits of practical-evaluative quarterly internship aimed at obtaining professional qualification in the medical, surgery and general medicine areas with general practitioners affiliated in the area.\n\nDuring this last two years, the student will address highly topical and socially relevant issues such as infertility, aging, oncology, palliative care and pain therapy.

The course is organized around three main learning areas:\n\nIT skills (introduction to computational thinking, database and data mining, web ontologies and logic, artificial intelligence) for which we rely on the skills and knowledge of other departments within Unict more specifically dedicated to this type of knowledge;\nlinguistic theory and treatment and analysis of textual data (linguistic theories for computational linguistics, corpus linguistics, databases and digital treatment of texts, writing for the web, pragmatics and communication, principles and applications of lexicography, quantitative methods for analysis of textual data);\nhistorical legal skills (intellectual property law and digital technologies, history and epistemology of machines, digital libraries).\nFor the historical field, however, the Disum already has within it suitable and relevant skills which will therefore be used and modulated to satisfy the cognitive needs of this new CdS, while for the legal one it will refer to other Departments. The graduate in Text Science for digital professions possesses transversal knowledge, with an important core of IT knowledge and a solid base of humanistic knowledge. Specifically, he is able to orient himself well between linguistic-textual, philological and literary knowledge, especially in relation to aspects related to their digital processing (archives, databases); IT knowledge, relating to the logical bases of programming, the construction of ontologies, databases, artificial intelligence, web interfaces; epistemological-sociological knowledge, with particular reference to informal reasoning skills, digital marketing, digital law, ethical problems of machines, algorithms, open data and big data. The course is aimed at training specialists in the processing and analysis of textual data with adequate skills in analyzing the impact of artificial intelligence.

      "description": "Activated with this denomination in the A.Y. 2013/2014, the CdS L12 - Linguistic and intercultural mediation has in just a few years recorded considerable appreciation among enrolled students, as demonstrated by the annual evaluations relating to the quality of teaching, the adequacy of infrastructures and services. Further proof of the rooting of the CdS in the territory and of the appreciation on the part of the enrolled students is the fact that there has progressively been a participation in the admission test of a number of candidates more than double the planned number: therefore, starting from 'a.a. 2017/18, it was deemed appropriate and sustainable to raise the planned number from 230 to 250.\n\nIn the CdS there is a high number of credits intended for linguistic teaching, both at a metalinguistic and instrumental level and the right space is given to the area of human sciences (teachings, literary, philosophical, historical, etc.), fundamental in the training of mediators cultural also in contexts of migration (remember that the Iblean coast was and still is one of the main places of disembarkation of migrants) and from the perspective of globalization. In the second year, through specific agreements, \"training and orientation internships\" and \"internships and internships at companies, public or private bodies, professional associations\" are envisaged, i.e. with subjects, among other things, in charge, in the present geo- historical, linguistic and intercultural mediation: in this regard, we can mention the stable collaborative relationships with the Prefecture of Ragusa, the Municipality of Ragusa, the provincial school world, the main actors of the third sector and the world of Iblean associations . These collaborations are not limited, of course, to the activation of internships and internships but are extended to other co-organised initiatives which are always consistent with the fundamental themes of the governance of migratory phenomena, the construction of new citizenship, training and updating. linguistic, as well as the promotion of the Iblean cultural heritage also at a tourist level.\nThe Iblean economic context saw the emergence, at the turn of the 21st century, of a notable reconversion from a traditionally agri-food economy to a purely tourist one, favored by the transformation of Comiso airport into a low-cost international airport, from the entrance of the Val di Well-known baroque in the list of UNESCO sites, from the development of tourist flows closely linked to the food and wine excellences present in the area and to the phenomenon of film tourism, due to the international success of the television series Inspector Montalbano (also studied, from a scientific point of view, at the SDS : http://www.sdslingue.unict.it/montalbano) and the choice of the Iblean territory as a set for important international film productions.\n\nOperating in a context subject to such crucial changes, the degree course (and the previous three-year degree courses in Linguistic Mediation Sciences and Comparative Studies) has consolidated an educational offer that is inclusive, as far as possible, of tourism and sociological disciplines and above all, over the years, it has consolidated an original vocation for the study of oriental languages (the teaching of Arabic and Japanese, activated since the 1999-2000 academic year), opening up to the teaching of Chinese and, in this sense, preceding all other similar degree courses operating in Sicily. This strategic choice was rewarded by student enrolments: the figures demonstrate [http://www.sdslingue.unict.it/corsi/l-12/il-corso-cifre] that the degree course is progressively more attractive in the context regional, so that a majority of members did not come from the province of Ragusa but from other Sicilian provinces.",

These objectives are achieved from the first year of the course thanks to in-depth study, both practical and theoretical, of two foreign languages (three-year courses) and Italian, as well as a third foreign language (two-year or three-year courses). In the following years, in addition to strengthening linguistic structures and theoretical reflection, students acquire, through lectures, exercises, seminars and various collateral context activities (participation in conferences, conferences, film clubs in foreign languages) further and in-depth historical-cultural and literary knowledge relating to the contextualisation of the languages studied.",

      "description": "“Teaching Empathy through Languages”\nA new course to address new training needs\n\nThe tumultuous transformations underway, the contacts and sometimes conflicts between different cultures, the speed of circulation of information, both locally and globally, require suitable tools for understanding, managing and solving problems. The ability to perceive a state of mind and a point of view different from ours is fundamental in an action of profound understanding of the interlocutor or mediation between different interlocutors. \"Feeling inside\" and \"putting yourself in the other person's shoes\" are actions called empathy.\n\nLanguage is the human tool par excellence, for communication and for the 'building' of empathy. There is no political, economic or cultural mediation that does not involve the 'construction' of an empathetic communication channel between the parties involved. Despite common opinion, it is not an innate ability: empathy can be taught. It is part of our common experience. Just using a few even basic expressions from the interlocutor's language is enough to open an immediate communication channel; to put him at ease; to make it feel interesting in our eyes; to reward him with a gift. A few months ago Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, during a business trip to China, impressed the world with a speech he recited in Mandarin at the most important university in China, where the country's ruling class is trained, Tsinghua University. Watch the video at the following LINK: you can clearly see how the audience, initially silent, distrustful, contracted while awaiting the event, changes mood, opens up, relaxes, amazed, upon hearing that the guest can speak or rather he wants to speak in Chinese. And you see the audience melt in the movement of empathy, smiling at the hesitation and the mistake, welcoming the effort and the homage paid to Chinese culture. Whatever Zuckerberg's motivation was (and whether it was a captatio benevolentiae aimed at the government to allow the use of Facebook in China), the speaker's choice is based on the tactic of taking advantage of the power of language to arouse empathetic relationships. It was certainly a spectacular result, which aroused the admiration of everyone, including haters.\nLanguage teaching is a complex profession, like mediation, which implies the possession of knowledge and skills, techniques and skills. Starting from these and other considerations, the council of the Special Teaching Structure of Foreign Languages and Literatures (dated 16/10/2018) and that of the Department of Humanities (dated 24/10/2018) have resolved to activate a Master's Degree Course, belonging to the LM-39 class, called \"Linguistic Sciences for interculture and training\". The course offers an advanced level training course in the field of language teaching, linguistic analysis, communication processes, intercultural mediation and social inclusion.\n\nThe course intends to train highly professional figures according to an interlinguistic and intercultural philosophy, capable of promoting language teaching, intercultural mediation and inclusion paths by taking care of specific linguistic needs. From this perspective, it also prepares experts in the drafting of texts, dossiers and dissemination materials, literary consultants, editorial consultants and cultural operators with functions of promotion and organization of events of different nature, the realization of which requires, among other things, the knowledge of one or more foreign languages.\nOur student will learn to teach languages, both Italian and foreign languages in which he will be a specialist: he will acquire credits to face - directly or with slight additions - a plurality of competitions in various humanistic teaching classes; he will learn mediation techniques between different cultures in complex situations.\n\n\nIt will also have a vast panorama of world literatures, since nothing represents and reflects cultures better than literature. He will study Arabic, Chinese, French, Japanese, English, Italian, Spanish and German language and literature. He will study advanced linguistics and multicultural philosophy.\nThe course provides in-depth knowledge of the main theories to allow the description of the various linguistic systems, the processing and analysis of data belonging to the different textual typologies. The theoretical and applicative tools for discourse analysis will be acquired, to develop models of learning Italian as an L2 and as a FL, to analyze linguistic needs and measure metalinguistic competence. Knowledge of theoretical models for the analysis of learners' plurilingual repertoires and for intercultural planning will be provided.\n\nThey will be explored further having identified the basic mechanisms that regulate linguistic variation at a diachronic and synchronic level, the advanced tools aimed at studying linguistic and intercultural contact also from the point of view of linguistic history and philology (L-LIN/01 - L-LIN/ 02 - L-FIL-LET/12 - L-FIL-LET/09 - L-FIL-LET/15). The skills to analyze sociolinguistic, ethnolinguistic and contact dynamics will be provided.\n\nGraduates will acquire a secure command of at least two foreign languages and literatures, as well as the ability to use the methodologies of critical analysis and literary comparison at an advanced level. They will be able to use linguistic knowledge to operate with awareness in the most diverse and complex communicative situations (characterizing training activities: L-LIN/04 - L-LIN/03 - L-LIN/07 - L-LIN/05 - L-LIN /12 - L-LIN/10 - L-LIN/11 - L-LIN/14 - L-LIN/13 - L-OR/12 - L-OR/21 - L-OR/22); thanks to related sectors, graduates will develop philosophical, historical, cultural, economic, geographical and legal knowledge and skills of intercultural communication (related sectors: M-FIL/06 - M-STO/04 - L-OR/ 10 - L-OR/23 - L-FIL-LET/04 - L-FIL-LET/10 - SECS-P/06 - M-GGR/01 IUS/14).\nThe motto of our course will be « Teaching Empathy through Languages »/« Enseigner l’empathie par le bias des languages ». The identity of Ragusa, the southernmost university in Europe, is built on these elements.",
