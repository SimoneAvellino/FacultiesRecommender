Starting from the study of physics and medical statistics, the fundamentals of chemistry and biochemistry, the biological organization of living organisms, the phenomena of gene transmission and expression, the microscopic and macroscopic structure of the organism, the student will acquire knowledge of the mechanisms of the functioning of the human body in physiological conditions to then understand the causes of disease and the defense mechanisms that the organism implements also in relation to the microorganism-host relationship. The student will also acquire knowledge regarding ethical standards, bioethics, history and the transcultural approach to medicine. Knowledge of a foreign language (English) and of the main information systems will also be provided, as well as the basis for developing knowledge in the biotechnology and scientific research fields, through \"open-lab\" experiences. The first part of the internship (10% of the total) will also be carried out in the form of \"Nursing\" in the medical and surgical area to begin developing skills relating to patient management, team work and the organization of the healthcare facility.\n\nSECOND TWO-YEAR PERIOD\n\nDuring the second two years, knowledge of the pathophysiological mechanisms will be deepened and the approach to the patient and the disease will begin through the study of clinical methodology, the main laboratory methods, drugs and substances of abuse, anatomopathological pictures and their evolution with particular reference to prevention. Knowledge of the most relevant diseases of the various systems (cardiovascular, respiratory, endocrine, digestive, urinary, skin), infectious diseases, diseases of the nervous system and psychiatry will be deepened. During the second two-year period, attendance at hospital facilities is expected to carry out a good part of the professional training (around 40% of the total) so that the knowledge acquired can be experienced in the field. The ability to clinically reason, to solve the most common problems in both the medical and surgical areas, to follow the evolution of the process from diagnosis to therapy, to understand when the intervention of a specialist is necessary will be among the skills developed through the activity practice. A specific internship in biomedical laboratories is also planned to refine skills and knowledge in the research field.\n\nTHIRD TWO-YEAR PERIOD\n\nDuring the third two-year period, the student will acquire all the useful elements to carry out his/her activity in order to maintain the overall state of health of the individual. The study of pharmacology and pathological anatomy will be completed and the knowledge relating to the diagnostic process will be perfected through knowledge of the main methodologies of diagnostic imaging. The student will acquire specific skills regarding the evaluation of epidemiological data, health promotion, prevention, and the area of clinical services medicine. They will learn to recognize various specialist pathologies (orthopaedics, physiatry, plastic and maxillofacial surgery, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, rheumatology) taking into account their role, and will acquire knowledge regarding pediatric and gynecological pathologies also through the professional training activities provided. As part of the credits to be obtained as professional activities, the student will carry out 15 credits of practical-evaluative quarterly internship aimed at obtaining professional qualification in the medical, surgery and general medicine areas with general practitioners affiliated in the area.\n\nDuring this last two years, the student will address highly topical and socially relevant issues such as infertility, aging, oncology, palliative care and pain therapy.

Santo Di Nuovo and to the President of the Regional Order of Psychologists Dr. Fulvio Giardina, also prof. Angelo Majorana, former full professor of Psychology at the Universities of Catania and Rome, the Dean of the Faculty of Psychology of Rome, prof. Nino Dazzi.\n\nThe new degree course, which had an immediate response from almost four hundred freshmen enrolled, arose from the need to activate training courses also in eastern Sicily aimed at preparing professionals capable of intervening in contexts in which the request for psychological services is particularly pressing and felt, as well as socially useful: in particular the scholastic and training context, and health and the prevention of discomfort.\n\nIn order to make the birth of a new Sicilian degree course as solid and unrealistic as possible, after the one that has already existed for some time in Palermo, three aspects were taken care of.\n\nFirst of all, preventive contact was established with the regional Order of Psychologists, with the aim of highlighting the actual employment and therefore training needs in the sector in Sicily, identifying the areas already saturated and those to be increased.\n\nThe profession of school psychologist was among the latter, together with the sector of risk prevention (pathological addictions, abuse, violence against minors, etc.) and health and well-being psychology, where a specially trained psychologist can find employment.\n\nPrecisely these two sectors were favored in the definition of the two curricula of the first level degree course, providing for the possibility of continuing in the following two years with specialist degrees in educational psychology and clinical psychology.\n\nVery useful in order to provide certainty regarding the ownership of the courses was the involvement, together with the Faculty of Education Sciences (which has the administrative management of the Degree Course), of the Faculties of Letters and Philosophy and Medicine and Surgery, structures which contributed extensively with their teaching resources at the initial development stage of the degree course.\n\nThe most qualifying element offered by the Consortium was certainly the assurance of a suitable number of tutors, graduates in psychology, who accompanied the 'freshmen' in the difficult start of their university career, avoiding as far as possible dangerous disconnects between students and teachers and supporting the teaching work with continuous and qualified assistance.\n\nAnother essential element of the new system, compared to the previous one, was the carrying out of internships already within the three-year degree course.\n\nThe importance of this innovation is related to the need to provide professionalization tools capable of placing the graduate, already after the three-year period and registration at the first level of the Register, on the job market with good employment prospects - and above all abilities , in the sectors and for the activities envisaged by Presidential Decree 328/2001 for the 'junior' psychologist.\n\nThe three-year degree course (together with the specialist degree course activated in succession to the three-year period in 2004) was maintained at the Enna site until 2007/'08, after the Enna University Consortium had been replaced starting from 2005 /'06 from 'Kore' University.\n\nSubsequently, the degree course moved to the Catania headquarters, Palazzo Ingrassia and the former \"Verginelle\" monastery, to be activated in the academic year. 2007/2008 and where, already in the previous academic year, the Specialist Degree course in Psychology had been activated (class 58/S).\n\nThe entire five-year offer (3+2) was at this point present in the Catania office.\n\n \n\nThe course trains a first level of psychological knowledge and skills and includes basic elements relating to:\n\npsychological, experimental and laboratory, life cycle, social and work, dynamic and clinical disciplines;\nrelated sciences such as neurophysiology, philosophy, pedagogy, sociology, important both for the interdisciplinary applications of psychological work and for a fuller understanding of the human mind and its individual and social behaviors.\nThrough laboratory activities, guided experiences and internships in external structures, the knowledge and skills acquired are or experimented on a practical level; all theoretical and methodological approaches are presented in depth, showing their applications to different sectors, such as educational, legal, rehabilitation, and the improvement of individual and social health and well-being.\nThe course includes all the curricular requirements to be able to access the master's degree in Psychology and for registration in the first level register of the Order of Psychologists, following a post-graduate internship and qualifying exam as required by current regulations.",

Further proof of the rooting of the CdS in the territory and of the appreciation on the part of the enrolled students is the fact that there has progressively been a participation in the admission test of a number of candidates more than double the planned number: therefore, starting from 'a.a. 2017/18, it was deemed appropriate and sustainable to raise the planned number from 230 to 250.\n\nIn the CdS there is a high number of credits intended for linguistic teaching, both at a metalinguistic and instrumental level and the right space is given to the area of human sciences (teachings, literary, philosophical, historical, etc.), fundamental in the training of mediators cultural also in contexts of migration (remember that the Iblean coast was and still is one of the main places of disembarkation of migrants) and from the perspective of globalization.

      "description": "“Teaching Empathy through Languages”\nA new course to address new training needs\n\nThe tumultuous transformations underway, the contacts and sometimes conflicts between different cultures, the speed of circulation of information, both locally and globally, require suitable tools for understanding, managing and solving problems. The ability to perceive a state of mind and a point of view different from ours is fundamental in an action of profound understanding of the interlocutor or mediation between different interlocutors. \"Feeling inside\" and \"putting yourself in the other person's shoes\" are actions called empathy.\n\nLanguage is the human tool par excellence, for communication and for the 'building' of empathy. There is no political, economic or cultural mediation that does not involve the 'construction' of an empathetic communication channel between the parties involved. Despite common opinion, it is not an innate ability: empathy can be taught. It is part of our common experience. Just using a few even basic expressions from the interlocutor's language is enough to open an immediate communication channel; to put him at ease; to make it feel interesting in our eyes; to reward him with a gift. A few months ago Mark Zuckerberg, the founder of Facebook, during a business trip to China, impressed the world with a speech he recited in Mandarin at the most important university in China, where the country's ruling class is trained, Tsinghua University. Watch the video at the following LINK: you can clearly see how the audience, initially silent, distrustful, contracted while awaiting the event, changes mood, opens up, relaxes, amazed, upon hearing that the guest can speak or rather he wants to speak in Chinese. And you see the audience melt in the movement of empathy, smiling at the hesitation and the mistake, welcoming the effort and the homage paid to Chinese culture. Whatever Zuckerberg's motivation was (and whether it was a captatio benevolentiae aimed at the government to allow the use of Facebook in China), the speaker's choice is based on the tactic of taking advantage of the power of language to arouse empathetic relationships. It was certainly a spectacular result, which aroused the admiration of everyone, including haters.\nLanguage teaching is a complex profession, like mediation, which implies the possession of knowledge and skills, techniques and skills. Starting from these and other considerations, the council of the Special Teaching Structure of Foreign Languages and Literatures (dated 16/10/2018) and that of the Department of Humanities (dated 24/10/2018) have resolved to activate a Master's Degree Course, belonging to the LM-39 class, called \"Linguistic Sciences for interculture and training\".
