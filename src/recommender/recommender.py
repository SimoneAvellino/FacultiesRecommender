        This system aims to ask the user as fewer questions as possible.
        The user query is a list of answers to questions while the
        interests text is a text that the user write about his interests.
        The recommendation is based on the following steps:\n
        1 - Finding users with similar interests.\n
        2 - Recommend faculties based on the user interests text.\n
        3 - The third step is to recommend faculties using information from
        point 1 and 2.\n

        This approach is based on the assumption that users with similar interests
        have similar preferences, but it's not always true especially
        when the questions are not enough to determine the user preferences.
        The text the user inputs is used to improve the recommendation.
        This idea comes from "4 Ristoranti", it uses the approach "Il mio voto
        puÃ² confermare o ribaltare la situazione".
